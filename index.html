              Imagine that you are a violin maker. You make the most beautiful,
              resonant instruments -- the best sounding violins in the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now imagine that all the tradesmen you know suddenly disappear.
              The timber merchant you buy your wood from: gone. The wire maker
              you buy wire from to make your strings. The man down the road
              who sells varnish. All of them are no more. What's more, you
              can't find anyone else who makes these things. The entire supply
              chain for your violin making business is gone. But you think
              making violins is really important, so you set about learning
              their trades.

              The regress isn't endless, but it goes a long way back, and it
              would take several lifetimes to acquire all the necessary
              skills. And even if you managed it, how much time would you have
              left to spend obsessing over what really mattered to you: the
              timbre and tone of your handmade instruments?
            </p>

            <p>
              What about a field you probably know more about? How many of you
              have ever written JavaScript?

          <aside class="notes">
            If you write JavaScript, you probably know something about the DOM
            programming model, built into every browser. Each browser runs on
            an Operating System which has its heart a kernel, which is almost
            certainly written in a programming language called C, and compiled
            with a C compiler: a large and very clever program such as GCC, or
            the IBM C compiler. That C compiler has a detailed understanding
            of the machine code understood by the particular processor in your
            computer. The machine code itself triggers the action of thousands
            of electronic components inside the processor. Each of these
            components may include hundreds of thousands of transistors. To
            understand a transistor you need a decent understanding of
            semiconductor physics, which in turn requires a not inconsiderable
            knowledge of...

          <h2>The Black Box</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              The answer is Black Box Abstraction: the process of wrapping
              complex things up into a box that hides most of the details of
              their construction, and idealises their behaviour so that you
              can reason about them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Black Box Abstraction is *everywhere* in the technological
              world. Assembly language is a BBA. Functions in languages like C
              are a BBA. Object-oriented programming is a BBA. Infrastructure
              as a Service is a BBA. Every single API ever written is a BBA.
            </p>

            <p>
              Except SOAP, which is the only known abstraction that's more
              complicated than the system it represents.
            </p>

            <p>
              Black Box Abstractions allow you to reason about systems of
              unreasonable complexity. The BBA is *the* central paradigm for
              technological advance. As soon as a technology or process can be
              packaged up in a black box through which it exposes a small but
              useful fraction of its inner complexity, its users can
              concentrate on *using* it, rather than trying to understand how
              it was made.

            <p>
              Designing black box abstractions, or, designing user APIs, to
              use a language that developers probably understand better, is,
              to my mind, the most important problem in software development
              that's unlikely to ever get any easier.
            </p>

            <p>
              But you can make it easier, and Mazz is going to talk to you
              about how we think you *can* make it easier &mdash; not easy,
              but easier.

          <h2>Team selection</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            What’s great about that clip from Ocean’s 11, aside from it being
            an awesome film, is it helps demonstrate the point we’re making.
            When GC asks BP what he thinks, BP doesn’t reel off that he needs
            10 identical BP. He recognises for a successful, v.challenging
            heist, it’s going to need a carefully balanced MIX of skillsets.
            The right number of carefully balanced skillset, hence the one
            more and making it 11.

          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            The team wouldn’t have been brought together without GC,
            recognising how important it is to assemble a great team and doing
            so is a skill in its own right. The same is true at GDS. Without
            Tom Loosemore putting together the initial team who did the beta
            for Gov.uk, there’d have been no real gov.uk. James Aylett, my
            friend and ex-boss(twice) as a CTO understood this and pulled
            together a team of developers with not just with a variety of
            skillsets but from different backgrounds. With great diversity
            comes great collective intelligence and power/ability.

          <h2>Understanding variety of depth of expertise</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            Building things is hard. It’s important to take the time to really
            understand what the right level of expertise your team or company
            needs, whether that’s building software, brewing beer or printing
            a steam train. You don’t have to understand all of the details,
            understand enough which bits are critical that need some level of
            pre-existing experience and which bits there’s room to grow or
            consult others for advice. It’s a balance between ideal and
            pragmatic. You’ve got to find the edges of the blackbox and adapt
            accordingly or hire people that will and then trust them to go do
            that.

          <h2>Rockstars need not apply</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            Let’s say you’ve got to build something quickly, I can see the
            allure of the silver bullet that if only you had 10 rockstar
            developers you’d get it done faster, stronger, better. Sorry
            folks, that’s just not true. I’m not saying that 10 novices are
            better than 1 expert, I’m saying that you need a diverse mix. If
            the team doesn’t play well together, you’re fucked. If you don’t
            put trust in the people you’ve chosen, you’re fucked. If you have
            a team full of identical people with little diversity, you’re
            fucked. Put your faith in rockstars and you’re fucked.

          <h2>User needs a Great Team</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            Many companies talk about that it’s “all about the team”, few
            actually live by that. Whether you’re making, selling,
            maintaining, developing or pulling off a heist. They all need good
            people. Only by the power of greyskull, no wait, power of
            collective intelligence of good people make a great team.

          <h2>When it goes wrong?</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            What happens if you don’t spend the time to make a great team?
            Come and talk to me in the pub afterwards and I can tell you some
            real life examples of the horror when it all goes wrong.
