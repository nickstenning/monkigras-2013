              Imagine that you are a violin maker. You make the most beautiful,
              resonant instruments -- the best sounding violins in the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now imagine that all the tradesmen you know suddenly disappear.
              The timber merchant you buy your wood from: gone. The wire maker
              you buy wire from to make your strings. The man down the road
              who sells varnish. All of them are no more. What's more, you
              can't find anyone else who makes these things. The entire supply
              chain for your violin making business is gone. But you think
              making violins is really important, so you set about learning
              their trades.

              It would take several lifetimes to acquire all the necessary
              skills. And even if you somehow managed it, how much time would you have
              left to spend on what really mattered? The sound of your violins.

            <p>
              As a violinmaker, you exist to serve violinists, and through
              them, the audience.

              We'll come back to violins later. What about a field you
              probably know more about? How many of you have ever written

            If you write JavaScript, you probably know something about the DOM
            programming model, built into every browser. Each browser runs on
            an Operating System which has its heart a kernel, which is almost
            certainly written in a programming language called C, and compiled
            with a C compiler: a large and very clever program such as GCC, or
            the IBM C compiler. That C compiler has a detailed understanding
            of the machine code understood by the particular processor in your
            computer. The machine code itself triggers the action of thousands
            of electronic components inside the processor. Each of these
            components may include hundreds of thousands of transistors. To
            understand a transistor you need a decent understanding of
            semiconductor physics, which in turn requires a not inconsiderable
            knowledge of...

            <p>
              But that's incredible, isn't it? JavaScript *couldn't exist*
              unless someone, at some point, understood quantum mechanics. But
              [none/only 1/only 2] of you claim to have any understanding of a

          <h2>The Black Box</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              The answer is Black Box Abstraction: the process of wrapping
              complex things up into a box that hides most of the details of
              their construction, and idealises their behaviour so that you
              can reason about them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our violin maker doesn't know how to fell a tree, and he doesn't
              know how to make an axe, but he has commercial relationships
              with people who do. And none of the complexity of forestry or
              axemaking leaks into those commercial relationships. So he
              doesn't have to worry.
            </p>

            <p>
              And you, coding JavaScript, don't need to understand QM because
              Black Box Abstraction is *everywhere* in the technological
              world. The DOM is a BBA. Functions are a BBA. Object-oriented
              programming is a BBA. Assembly language is a BBA. Infrastructure
              as a Service is a BBA. Every single API ever written is a BBA.
            </p>

            <p>
              Except SOAP, which is the only known abstraction that's more
              complicated than the system it represents.
            </p>

            <p>
              Black Box Abstractions allow you to reason about systems of
              unreasonable complexity, and they are *the* central paradigm for
              technological advance. As soon as a technology or process can be
              packaged up in a black box through which it exposes a small but
              useful fraction of its inner complexity, its users can
              concentrate on *using* it, rather than trying to understand how
              it was made.

            Well, the first thing you need to do is Stop. Stop and think. 
            Think then think harder and then think some more. 
            There is no "quick win" for this, when I rule the world that phrase 
            "quick win" will be illegal.
            Think about what black boxes can you draw around functions at work? 
            Don't think job titles, think areas of problems/know-how.
            The lines will be fuzzy in places and that's OK.
            It takes time to figure out where the edges of the box are 
            and it may contain other boxes within it. 
            I'm not talking on a macro level of what coding language
            to use, which tools and processes to put in place, 
            I'm talking about the secret ingredient... People.

          <!-- pic attribution: http://www.flickr.com/photos/scarygami/4244831459/ -->
          <aside class="notes">
            When the idea of the alpha of GOV.UK was being baked, those discussing
            its possiblity took the time to think about what flavour of people
            they'd need. People like Tom Looosemore
            don't particularly have in-depth technology know-how, what they had 
            was an understanding of the importance of each of the black boxes
            needed and to what depth of know-how was needed given the incredibly 
            short time scale. They thought about it some more, found the edges and 
            then they pulled together a team of about a dozen people who in 12 weeks 
            successfuly built the alpha.
            There was much rejoicing.
            Then shit got real. 
            How do you scale from a team of 12 to what ended up being a team of around 140

            Recognising how important it is to assemble a good team and doing
            so is a skill in its own right. 
            Time was taken to re-evaluate what flavours of people were needed 
            to build on that success and make GOV.UK "for real". 
            There seems to me, a common misconception in tech that you need
            rock stars to deliver, faster better stronger code. 
            This is a lie.
            No one person can carry the success of your product/team
            and to think like that is introducing a single point of failure.
            Get a team of rockstars together and you'll have a disaster. 
            A faster, worse-erer disastrous fuck up. I'm tired of seeing the same
            description of what makes for "great developers", like carbon clones
            of each other who live and breathe code and drink from the 
            same ego-boosting kool aid.
            This is bullshit.
            There is not a single rock star in sight at GDS, this was no accident.

            Building things is hard. It’s a balance between ideal and
            pragmatic. You’ve got to find the edges of the blackbox and adapt
            accordingly or hire people that will and then trust them to go do
            that.

            There is no silver bullet and what works for one problem doesn't work
            for another. Scripts that were hacked together to build a vm 
            during the beta were no longer susatinable. We had to 
            continually iterate and scale the tools and process to fit the 
            ever expanding new team. We didn't always have the "expertise", that
            didn't stop us because we had the right flavour of people who are 
            intelligent, fun and above all respectful. 
            We worked together and figured stuff out as best we could.

            On paper, going from the beta to LIVE, shouldn't really have ever have worked.
            It was insane. It was hard work. 
            It was only possible because we never lost sight of the most important thing...

            The most important thing is what your end user wants.
            Whether it's to play a beautiful violin or to make GOV.UK for real, the user
            doesn't care about your ego: leave that at the door. A well fitted
            team will make the most of collective intelligence and be able to
            solve any problem that comes their way because they understand
            the edges of the black boxes and have the ability to not try and 
            solve it all by themselves.

            make different things.
