              Imagine, for a moment, that you are a violin maker. Antonio
              Stradivari, or, if you like, Giuseppe Guarneri. You are a
              craftsman with an immense knowledge of your art, and years upon
              years of experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              What would happen if all the tradesmen you knew suddenly
              disappeared? The timber merchant you buy your wood from: gone.
              The wire maker you buy wire from to make your strings and the
              man down the road who sells varnish. All of them are no more.
            </p>

            <p>
              In a flash of horror, you suddenly realise the immense chain of
              resources and trades that you depended upon for your livelihood
              as a luthier.

              Let's pick just a single component of your violins: the sides of
              the violin, or "ribs". These are usually made by heat bending
              strips of hardwood -- typically maple. Before the small blocks
              of maple get to you, they have been attended by the skills of an
              entire industry: a sawyer at a lumber yard, who turns trees into
              planks and blocks. A lumberjack who felled the tree. But the
              lumberjack uses an axe, which requires an axemaker or a
              blacksmith to forge the axe head. All of these are highly
              skilled trades, requiring years of training and practice. No one
              person could ever hope to succeed in all of them simultaneously.
              Even if you somehow managed it, how much time would you have
              left to spend on what really mattered? The sound of your
              violins.
            </p>

            <p>
              After all, as a violinmaker, you exist to serve violinists, and
              through them, the audience.
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll come back to violins. What about a field you probably know
              more about? How many of you have ever written JavaScript?

            If you write JavaScript, you probably know something about the DOM
            programming model, built into every browser. Each browser runs on
            an Operating System which has its heart a kernel, which is almost
            certainly written in a programming language called C, and compiled
            with a C compiler: a large and very clever program such as GCC.
            That C compiler has a detailed understanding of the machine code
            understood by the particular processor in your computer. The
            machine code itself triggers the action of thousands of electronic
            components inside the processor. Each of these components may
            include hundreds of thousands or millions of transistors. To
            understand a transistor you need a decent understanding of
            semiconductor physics, which in turn requires a not inconsiderable
            knowledge of...

              I asked you how many of you had ever written any JavaScript. How
              many of you have a firm grasp of quantum mechanics?

            <p>
              But that's incredible, isn't it? JavaScript *couldn't exist*
              unless someone, at some point, understood quantum mechanics. But
              [none/only 1/only 2] of you claim to have any understanding of a
              technology on which JavaScript is fundamentally dependent.

              The answer is Black Box Abstraction: the process of wrapping
              complex or complicated things up into a box that has pipes to
              get stuff into it, and pipes to get stuff out of it, but which
              hides the full complexity of its internal machinery.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our violin maker doesn't know how to fell a tree, and he doesn't
              know how to make an axe, but he has commercial relationships
              with people who do. And none of the complexity of forestry or
              axemaking leaks into those commercial relationships. So he
              doesn't have to worry about these issues, and can concentrate on
              what he's good at.
            </p>

            <p>
              And you, coding JavaScript, don't need to understand QM because
              Black Box Abstraction is *everywhere* in the technological
              world. The DOM is a BBA. Functions are a BBA. Object-oriented
              programming is a BBA. Assembly language is a BBA. Infrastructure
              as a Service is a BBA. Every single API ever written is a BBA.
            </p>

            <p>
              Except SOAP, which is the only known abstraction that's more
              complicated than the system it represents.
            </p>

            <p>
              Black Box Abstractions allow you to reason about systems of
              unreasonable complexity, and they are *the* central paradigm for
              technological advance. As soon as a technology or process can be
              packaged up in a black box through which it exposes a small but
              useful fraction of its inner complexity, its users can
              concentrate on *using* it, rather than trying to understand how
              it was made.

              <strong>Nick:</strong> Picking the right abstractions, or
              designing interfaces, or APIs, or whatever you call them -- is
              *hard*. There's no rulebook, and no algorithms to help you, and
              doing it right requires one thing above all others: that you
              understand the *people* who will be using what you make.

          <h2>GDS intro</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              We work at GDS, some of you might be familiar with the website we worked on, www.gov.uk. Front door to british government information and services.

              Gov.uk started out as an idea, an alpha. The idea was:
              "To test, in public, a prototype of a new, single UK Government website./
              shaped by an obsession with meeting user needs"

              In (Feb 2011-May), in just 12 weeks, a cross-disciplinary team of a only dozen people(6 devs) successfuly built the alpha of GOV.UK, 
              from scratch. There was much rejoicing. 
              Then shit started to get serious. The idea was approved to build the next stage which was a beta.

              The beta was done in (2011 June, Jan 2012) 8 months, worked on by a cross-disciplined team of 43. (approx 10 devs)

              Then shit got real. The go-ahead was given for the beta to be turned into THE single UK Government website, for real.
              Started on Feb 2012 and got launched in October 2012 (9months), worked on by a cross-disciplined team of approx 140 people(approx devs 20).

              How did we go from a team of 12 to a team of 140 over XX amount of time?

              There seems to me, to be a common misconception in tech that all you need
              to deliver, faster better stronger code is a rock star.
              This is a lie.
              No one person can carry the success of your product/team
              and to think like that is introducing a single point of failure.
              Have a rockstar on your team and you'll have a disaster. 
              A faster, worse-erer fuck up.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm tired of seeing the same
              description of what makes "great rock star developers", like carbon clones
              of each other, who all must live and breathe code and drink from the 
              same ego-boosting kool aid. 

              Shouting the same opinions over each other about the "right way" to do something
              and inevitably making mistakes with the same blind spots.
              <!-- picture of T-Rex eating rock star -->
              Needing rockstars, is bullshit. Think about what this is doing to your team if your rock
              star ups and leaves/gets eaten by a T-rex. Rock stars don't always work well with
              others. 

              They believe that their egos are more important than listening to what users need and there is very little collective intelligence left within the team.  

              If you can't work with others from different disciplines, you can't see the black boxes, let alone interact with them.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is another way. 

              And that is cross-disciplinary teams, working together.

              I'm proud to be able to say that there is not a single rock star in sight at GDS, this was no accident.
              How did we do it then?

            <p>
              Recognising how important it is to assemble a good, passionate team and doing
              so, is a skill in its own right.
              It wasn't about hiring "just" the very best technical minds,
              it was about hiring a diverse group of people who were best 
              able to understand what gov.uk was trying to achieve.

              Because building things is hard, you’ve got to understand who you're
              building for, and what they want to see. 

              If you want others to use your work, you need to understand how much of the complexity
              of what you're doing -- whether it's writing code or explaining
              government policies --that you need to expose. 

              So, you need to hire people that really get that, and then trust them to go build for
              their users.

              There is no silver bullet and what works for one problem doesn't
              work for another. 

              [publisher, first pass sat right next to each other, not scale.]

              Tools and processes that were hacked together
              for the beta by a group who were talking to one another all
              the time didn't scale as teams got larger. We had to continually
              iterate and scale those tools and process to fit the ever
              expanding new team, who had a different set of needs. 

              We didn't always have the "know-how",
              but that didn't stop us because we had the right people who
              are intelligent, fun and above all respectful. We worked
              together and figured stuff out together, as best we could.
              Then iterated and made it better again.

              On paper, going from alpha, to beta then LIVE in such a short time frame, 
              shouldn't have worked. 

              It seemed impossible.

              It was only possible because as a team we never lost sight of the 
              most important thing...

            <p>
              The story of the violinmaker tells us that every maker depends
              on a huge chain of other makers. What makes the violinmaker's
              work possible is the black box abstraction: he puts money in the
              timber merchant's black box and wood comes out.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you're a maker, you should focus on how to best serve the
              needs of your user, who might well be another maker. After all,
              the violinmaker is only making violins so that a violinist can
              play them.
            </p>

            <p>
              The GDS Design principles sum this up: start with needs, but I
              also like the way Kenneth Reitz, a programmer at Heroku, puts
              it: "The user API is all that matters. Everything else is
              secondary."

              <strong>Mazz:</strong>
              Ok, so Uncle Ben and Stan Lee didn't exactly say this but I'm sure they would if they worked with us.
              A diverse, well fitted team will make the most of collective intelligence. 
              They know that the user doesn't care about your ego: you need to leave that at the door
              to truly get shit done. GOV.UK is a testament to this philosophy.

              Remember: Everyone is a maker, they just make different things.
              You should be making for makers.
