              Imagine that you are a violin maker. You make the most beautiful,
              resonant instruments -- the best sounding violins in the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now imagine that all the tradesmen you know suddenly disappear.
              The timber merchant you buy your wood from: gone. The wire maker
              you buy wire from to make your strings. The man down the road
              who sells varnish. All of them are no more. What's more, you
              can't find anyone else who makes these things. The entire supply
              chain for your violin making business is gone. But you think
              making violins is really important, so you set about learning
              their trades.

              It would take several lifetimes to acquire all the necessary
              skills. And even if you somehow managed it, how much time would you have
              left to spend on what really mattered? The sound of your violins.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a violinmaker, you exist to serve violinists, and through
              them, the audience.

              We'll come back to violins later. What about a field you
              probably know more about? How many of you have ever written
              JavaScript?

            If you write JavaScript, you probably know something about the DOM
            programming model, built into every browser. Each browser runs on
            an Operating System which has its heart a kernel, which is almost
            certainly written in a programming language called C, and compiled
            with a C compiler: a large and very clever program such as GCC, or
            the IBM C compiler. That C compiler has a detailed understanding
            of the machine code understood by the particular processor in your
            computer. The machine code itself triggers the action of thousands
            of electronic components inside the processor. Each of these
            components may include hundreds of thousands of transistors. To
            understand a transistor you need a decent understanding of
            semiconductor physics, which in turn requires a not inconsiderable
            knowledge of...

              I asked you how many of you had ever written any JavaScript. How
              many of you have a firm grasp of quantum mechanics?

            <p>
              But that's incredible, isn't it? JavaScript *couldn't exist*
              unless someone, at some point, understood quantum mechanics. But
              [none/only 1/only 2] of you claim to have any understanding of a
              technology on which JavaScript is fundamentally dependent.

          <h2>The Black Box</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              The answer is Black Box Abstraction: the process of wrapping
              complex things up into a box that hides most of the details of
              their construction, and idealises their behaviour so that you
              can reason about them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our violin maker doesn't know how to fell a tree, and he doesn't
              know how to make an axe, but he has commercial relationships
              with people who do. And none of the complexity of forestry or
              axemaking leaks into those commercial relationships. So he
              doesn't have to worry.
            </p>

            <p>
              And you, coding JavaScript, don't need to understand QM because
              Black Box Abstraction is *everywhere* in the technological
              world. The DOM is a BBA. Functions are a BBA. Object-oriented
              programming is a BBA. Assembly language is a BBA. Infrastructure
              as a Service is a BBA. Every single API ever written is a BBA.
            </p>

            <p>
              Except SOAP, which is the only known abstraction that's more
              complicated than the system it represents.
            </p>

            <p>
              Black Box Abstractions allow you to reason about systems of
              unreasonable complexity, and they are *the* central paradigm for
              technological advance. As soon as a technology or process can be
              packaged up in a black box through which it exposes a small but
              useful fraction of its inner complexity, its users can
              concentrate on *using* it, rather than trying to understand how
              it was made.

            For a successful<br>
            <strong>website/heist/thing</strong><br>
            take time to think
          </h2>

          <!-- TODO: rethink prominence of Ocean's 11 analogy -->

          <aside class="notes">
            What’s great about that clip from Ocean’s 11, aside from it being
            an awesome film, is it helps demonstrate the point we’re making.
            When GC asks BP what he thinks, BP doesn’t reel off that he needs
            10 identical BP. He recognises for a successful, v.challenging
            heist, it’s going to need a carefully balanced MIX of skillsets.
            The right number of carefully balanced skillset, hence the one
            more and making it 11.


            In this clip we see them taking time to figure out the edges of
            the plan and what flavour of people they need for it to be a
            success. They each have areas of expertise: they themselves do not
            have explives skills or tech or impersonation but they understand
            the importance of each and how it has to fit well together.

          <h2>Rock stars need not apply</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            The team wouldn’t have been brought together without GC,
            recognising how important it is to assemble a great team and doing
            so is a skill in its own right. The same is true at GDS. Without
            Tom Loosemore putting together the initial team who did the beta
            for Gov.uk, there’d have been no real gov.uk. James Aylett, my
            friend and ex-boss(twice) as a CTO understood this and pulled
            together a team of developers with not just with a variety of
            skillsets but from different backgrounds. With great diversity
            comes great collective intelligence and power/ability.

            When building the beta of GOV.UK Tom Loosemore was the equivalent
            of George Clooney. He took th etime to understand what skills were
            essential to build something in a very short space of time and got
            the right people. When this was a hit, time was then taken to
            reevaluate what flavours of people were needed to build on that
            success. No on eperson can carry the ssuccess of your product/team
            and to think that is a single point of failure.

            Common misconception in tech that you need rock stars to deliver
            faster, better, stronger.

            Sorry, this is a lie.

          <h2>Good team needs diverse good people</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            Building things is hard. It’s important to take the time to really
            understand what the right level of expertise your team or company
            needs, whether that’s building software, brewing beer or printing
            a steam train. You don’t have to understand all of the details,
            understand enough which bits are critical that need some level of
            pre-existing experience and which bits there’s room to grow or
            consult others for advice. It’s a balance between ideal and
            pragmatic. You’ve got to find the edges of the blackbox and adapt
            accordingly or hire people that will and then trust them to go do
            that.

            There is no silver bullet and what works for one problem doesn't
            work for another. When building GOV.UK to be for real, needed to
            re-identify what the edges were. Scripts that were knocked
            together to build a VM were no longer sustainable. Had to change
            the tools and process to fit the new team and end goal.

            All comes back to not losing sight of what your end user wants.
            Whether it's a successful heist or GOV.UK working, the suer
            doesn't care about your ego: leave that at the door. A well fitted
            team will make the most of collective intelligence and be able to
            solve any problem that comes therir way because they understand
            the edges of their ability and not solve it all by them selves.
            Everyone is a maker, they just make different things.
